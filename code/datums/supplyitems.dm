//SUPPLY PACKS
//NOTE: only secure crate types use the access var (and are lockable)
//NOTE: hidden packs only show up when the computer has been hacked.
//ANOTHER NOTE: Contraband is obtainable through modified supplycomp circuitboards.
//BIG NOTE: Don't add living things to crates, that's bad, it will break the shuttle.
//NEW NOTE: Do NOT set the price of any crates below 7 points. Doing so allows infinite points.

// Supply Groups
//	var/const/supply_emergency 	= 1
//	var/const/supply_security 	= 2
//	var/const/supply_engineer	= 3

//	var/const/supply_misc		= 8
//	var/const/supply_vend		= 9

// Easy format for cargo list
// containername = [] sets a name for your container, which is not needed most of the time because items already come with a default "containername" defined in the item's header, while containertype = [] sets the type of container, which also tends to be defined in the item's header
// count = [] will set the amount of sheets/items if the object is stackable
// The variables above can be put directly into the following fromat if the object(s) being ordered require it
// 
// Format below:
//  /datum/supply_item//
//	    name = ""
//	    contains = list()
//	    cost = 100
//	    desc = "."
// 
// Example, explanations in [brackets]:
//  /datum/supply_item/materials [the category this cargo order is under]/metal [this bit here does not matter, just give it a normal name with no spaces]
//	    name = "Metal" [name that shows up in the cargo menu]
//	    contains = list(/obj/item/stack/sheet/metal) [the object being ordered, can be found by right-clicking on an object, clicking "variables", the path will be in the upper right corner]
//	    amount = 50 [how many items, only works if item is stackable, if you are ordering multiple items that are not stackable, look at the next example]
//	    cost = 200 [price]
//	    containertype = /obj/structure/closet/crate/secure/large [type of container, preferably one under /secure/ so it can be locked]
//	    desc = "50 sheets of metal." [description shown in the cargo menu]
//
// Example for ordering multiple items:
//  /datum/supply_item/engineering/solars
//	    name = "Solar Panel Crate"
//	    contains = list(/obj/item/solar_assembly,
//					    /obj/item/solar_assembly,
//					    /obj/item/solar_assembly,
//					    /obj/item/solar_assembly,
//					    /obj/item/solar_assembly,
//					    /obj/item/solar_assembly)
//	    cost = 200
//	    desc = "5 solar panels."
//
// As shown above, to order multiple items, just leave a comma at the end of each object being ordered and press "enter", last object should end in a ")"
// The objects do not have to be the same, you can order different items under one cargo order, as long as the requirements I said above are met
